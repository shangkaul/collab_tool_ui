# Concurrent React App

This web app was part of a POC on creating a concurrent view application on the MERN stack.
<br/>

The app is hosted on Netlify here: https://superteam-collab.netlify.com/
<br/>

Before testing make sure the backend is running. - https://replit.com/@shangkaul/collabserver

This react app would be a concurrent dashboard app wherein we'll have automated jobs using AWS, that bring in the data for an NGO. This data is then used to create additional dashboards. User can create task sheets in the workspace and also view dashboards in the report module.
Thanks!
